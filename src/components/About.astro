        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">Mission & Motivation</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I’m someone who likes and believes in building fast, efficient, and reliable software systems that are applicable on real world cases. As a graduate of Bachelors in computer science my interests span scientific computing, AI, and systems engineering. I'm currently a Research Software Engineer at IFIC Valencia, working on projects in collaboration with LHCb and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider (World's Largest Particle Accelerator at CERN). Being part of such opportunities has shown me what truly high-demand data systems look like, and it continues to shape how I think about performance and engineering.

      <!-- Block 2: Experience -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">Technical Experience</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Before this, I gained experience across different domains — as an AI intern at Nihin Media K.K., where I built deployed machine learning tools, and through Google Summer of Code with CERN-HSF, where I helped improve scientific computing workflows requiring reliability and careful problem-solving. In the past few years, I've mainly focused on backend development, data science, and AI, building systems in C++ and Python from storage components to practical ML tools. I also learned data science and AI through reputable programs from IIT Delhi, IIT Madras, NVIDIA, IBM, and Meta, combining structured learning with hands-on work to approach problems with clarity and practicality.

      <!-- Block 3: Community and Leadership -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">Community & Leadership</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've also been active in my college's tech community. I served as the AI/ML domain lead for the Center for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship, where I mentored students, organized workshops, taught AI/ML fundamentals, and helped run hackathons to build a practical and collaborative learning environment.

      <!-- Block 4: What shapes my actions ?  -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-300 mb-3">Philosophy & Approach</h3>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          I've always been a curious person, but I also believe it's equally important to stay practical and reliable in what I build. I often take the harder route and create things from scratch because it helps me understand them properly. I enjoy collaborating with people from different domains and believe that clear communication is key to solving complex problems effectively.

<!--
Key Changes:
- Layout: We removed the `grid` and `md:grid-cols-2` classes. The parent `div` now has `space-y-12`, which creates vertical spacing between each of the four content blocks.
- Structure: Each paragraph is now wrapped in its own `div` with a subheading (`h3`) and the paragraph text (`p`).
- Subheadings: The `h3` tags are styled to stand out with a larger size (`text-2xl`), a semi-bold weight, and the theme's accent color (`text-indigo-300`).
- Readability: Added `leading-relaxed` to the paragraphs to increase the line spacing slightly, making the larger blocks of text easier to read.
