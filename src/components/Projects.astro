    title: "Energy Profiling & Optimization at CERN-LHCb",
    description: "I worked on analyzing the energy use of track-reconstruction software inside the ACTS C++ framework. I developed an energy-profiling module and used it to study the behavior of key fitting algorithms such as the Combinatorial Kalman Filter (CKF), Gaussian Sum Filter (GSF), and Runge–Kutta–based track propagation. This helped identify inefficiencies and provided clear insights to improve performance for LHCb and ATLAS workflows.",

  {
    title: "Google Summer of Code - Quantum Algorithm Benchmarking",
    description: "I developed a Python framework that implements classical ML algorithms and simulates quantum ML algorithms on classical hardware. The goal was to estimate the energy use and performance researchers can expect when running the same processes on real quantum hardware, giving them a practical baseline before using actual quantum systems.",

  {
    title: "High-Performance Time Series Database Engine",
    description: "Seeing the limits of general-purpose databases for time-series workloads, I set out to build my own storage engine. I designed a C++17 system with custom compression and a log-structured, time-sharded architecture, benchmarking it on an Intel i7-12700H, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, and NVMe Gen4 SSD, where it achieved ~50% better storage efficiency and sub-millisecond query times on real datasets.",

  },
  {
    title: "Distributed Fault-Tolerant Cache System",
    description: "To understand how distributed systems achieve reliability at scale, I built a fault-tolerant key-value store from scratch. Using consistent hashing, N-way replication, and automated chaos testing, I validated the system on an Intel i7-12700H, 16 GB RAM, NVMe Gen4 SSD, where it sustained 17k GET ops/sec with zero data loss, even during simulated node failures.",

New Tailwind Classes:
- `flex-col`: Stacks items vertically.
- `gap-12`: Adds a gap between the project cards.
- `transform hover:-translate-y-2 transition-transform duration-300`: A group of classes that creates a cool "lift-up" effect when you hover over a card.
- `flex-wrap`: Allows the tag items to wrap to the next line if there isn't enough space.
- `bg-indigo-600/50`: Sets the background color to indigo, but with 50% opacity.
